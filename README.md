# RhythmTrainer

Rhythm Trainer is a hobby project made with the Godot Game Engine and was started in the summer of 2023. It is my first introduction to object-oriented programming, Godot, and app design.

The purpose of this project was to create a space for growing musicians to hone their skills anywhere by sight reading rhythms. The guiding principles in the development of the app were to make practice as easy, frequent, effective, and customizable as possible.

At the app's core is an algorithm capable of generating random, realistic rhythms as sheet music. Near-total control is given to the user over the generation of sheet music in the Generation Settings Menu. Users are able to adjust settings from as basic as note or rest probabilities to as complex as syncopation probabilities. Theses settings are also simplified with out-of-the-box presets and can be simplified with user presets.
